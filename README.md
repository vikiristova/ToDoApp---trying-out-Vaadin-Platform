# Vaadin
is a Java framework for building modern web applications. This is a simple crud to do application for testing out the possibilities which Vaadin offers. It lets you forget the web and program user interfaces much like you would program a desktop application with conventional Java toolkits such as AWT, Swing, or SWT. But easier.  
While traditional web programming is a fun way to spend your time learning new web technologies, you probably want to be productive and concentrate on the application logic. The server-side Vaadin framework takes care of managing the user interface in the browser and the AJAX communications between the browser and the server.
## With the Vaadin approach, you do not need to learn and deal directly with browser technologies, such as HTML or JavaScript.
